### Manual Installation

How To Install:

1. Download

2. Extract to /usr/share/themes
or ~/.themes (create it (in your home folder) if necessary);

3. Change via distribution specific tweak tool.

After the installation is complete you can activate the theme with `gnome-tweak-tool` or a similar program by selecting `OSX-Arc-White`, `OSX-Arc-Darker` or `OSX-Arc-Shadow` as Window/GTK+ theme and `OSX-Arc-White`, `OSX-Arc-Darker` or `OSX-Arc-Shadow` as Gnome Shell/Cinnamon theme.

##

### System Requirements

**Note:** If your distribution doesn't ship separate development packages you just need GTK 3 instead of the `-dev` packages.

For the theme to function properly, install the following
* Gnome Shell, GTK 3.14 - 3.22
* The `gnome-themes-standard` package
* The murrine engine. This has different names depending on your distro.
  * `gtk-engine-murrine` (Arch Linux)
  * `gtk2-engines-murrine` (Debian, Ubuntu, elementary OS)
  * `gtk-murrine-engine` (Fedora)
  * `gtk2-engine-murrine` (openSUSE)
  * `gtk-engines-murrine` (Gentoo)

## 

### Uninstall

If previous versions were installed or existed, remove them first.

Run (As ROOT User)

    sudo rm -rf /usr/share/themes/{OSX-Arc-White,OSX-Arc-Darker,OSX-Arc-Shadow}

Run (As Local User)    
    
    rm -rf ~/.local/share/themes/{OSX-Arc-White,OSX-Arc-Darker,OSX-Arc-Shadow}

## 

### Troubleshooting

If you have Ubuntu with a newer GTK/Gnome version than the one included by default (i.e Ubuntu 14.04 with GTK 3.14 or Ubuntu 15.04 with GTK 3.16, etc.) you have to install the theme manually as described above.
This is also true for other distros with a different GTK/Gnome version than the one included by default

--

If you get artifacts like black or invisible backgrounds under Unity, disable overlay scrollbars with

    gsettings set com.canonical.desktop.interface scrollbar-mode normal
